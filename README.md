## 💼 Experience Highlights

**🔹 Project 1: Judicial Expertise Automation Platform (from scratch)**  
- Designed architecture microservices (Spring Cloud: Gateway, Eureka, Config)  
- Set up asynchronous, high-load messaging with Apache Kafka  
- Implemented Keycloak security (OAuth2, JWT, RBAC)  
- Built secure file storage via MinIO; used MongoDB for dynamic templates  
- Achieved 80% unit test coverage; configured CI/CD; stress-tested via k6  
- Led a 5-person team: planning, code review, quality control  
> 🚀 Functional version successfully demoed to the Ministry of Justice  

**🔹 Project 2: State Patent Management System (legacy)**  
- Supported and refactored high-load microservices with proprietary/internal dependencies  
- Integrated external government APIs and internal message broker  
- Optimized PostgreSQL performance (indexes, query tuning), added ElasticSearch  
- Improved test coverage (JUnit, Mockito); wrote technical documentation  
> 🛠️ Stabilized a legacy codebase, integrated external services, and migrated part of the core logic from a monolith to microservices, improving developer onboarding by 40%.
